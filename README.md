# Assignment Project 1 (Front-End Development)

This a responsive website for a fictional western food company site i designed and developed. I have made use HTML, CSS, Javascript and modern web development techniques to build a static front-end responsive website. With how advanced technology has come about, an online website will be required to help promoto the company business and also give more convenience to consumers. With the website i have developed, consumers can find information about the company and details of the product with ease. As it is for a western food restaurant, online booking is now possible with just a few clicks through the website.
 
## Design Process

This website is made for online consumer who want to see more details of what product is being sold which includes the description, price and an image of the product. It also provide a way to do online reservation for table booking. The website i have developed will allow easier and convenience way of viewing the company products and details and also provide a fast method to do online booking.

As a customer, i want to know if i can book a table in advance, so that i can skip the time of waiting and enjoy my meal.

These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Book A Table form:
    1. Go to the "Book Table" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
2. Menu:
    1. Try to click on any of the menu option and verify that it brings u to that page
    2. Try using the website on mobile or smaller screen, verify if the hamburger appears and verify when click upon does the menu option appears
3. Scroll to top button:
    1. Scroll to the buttom or to any other page except for home
    2. Try to click on the button and verify if it brings you to the top of the page
4. Swiper for home page:
    1. Swipe left or right to verify if it changes slide
    2. Try to click on the left or right arrow to switch slide

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
